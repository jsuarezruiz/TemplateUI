Supported platforms:
* Android
* iOS

_What is a templated control?_

It is a control defined by a template. Every control has a **ControlTemplate** property and can modify the structure that defines the control.
  
## Usage

**Step 1**: Add a reference to TemplateUI. 

**NOTE:** Currently TemplateUI is not yet available in NuGet. _But... why?_. There are a couple more controls and some fixes almost ready. After merge and polish details, TemplateUI will be in NuGet.

**Step 2**: Initialize TemplateUI in your shared library:

`TemplateUI.Init();`

**Step 3**: Enjoy coding!.

## Overview

There are currently **18 controls**. The controls available are:

### TreeView

Enables a hierarchical list with expanding and collapsing nodes that contain nested items.

#### Layouts

But ... isn't this a templated controls library? You are right. But to create certain controls, there are layouts that would help to achieve the desired result. For example, in the list of upcoming controls we have a Clock. To position the elements that make up the Clock, a CircularLayout makes things very simple.

These Layouts, in addition to adding more possibilities to the library, help to create more templated controls.

The **layouts** available are:

### CircularLayout

The CircularLayout is a simple Layout derivative that lays out its children in a circular arrangement. 
It has some useful properties to allow some customization like the Orientation (Clockwise or Counterclockwise).

### DockLayout

The DockLayout makes it easy to dock content in all four directions (top, bottom, left and right). 
This makes it a great choice in many situations, where you want to divide the screen into specific areas, 
especially because by default, the last element inside the DockLayout, unless this feature is specifically disabled, 
will automatically fill the rest of the space (center).

### HexLayout

A Layout that arranges the elements in a honeycomb pattern.

## Feedback or Requests

Use GitHub [Issues](https://github.com/jsuarezruiz/TemplateUI/issues) for bug reports and feature requests.

## Principles

* Principle #1: Kept TemplateUI simple.
* Principle #2: Any control added must allow customization using the ControlTemplate property.

## Known Issues

* A lot of the controls are made up of basic shapes. Gestures don't work with Shapes on iOS. This affects some control like Rate. (waiting [PR #11419](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms/pull/11419))

## What's next

The next controls will be:
* Clock
* TabView

In addition, there are ideas for a wide variety of controls like:
* Calendar
* ColorPicker
* DataGrid
* Horizontal Calendar
* Loading
* Pagination
* StepBar
* TimeBar

And much more!
